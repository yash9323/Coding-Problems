
Reverse a linked list: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the order of the nodes in the list.

Find the middle element of a linked list: Given the head of a singly linked list, find the middle element of the list.

Check if a binary tree is balanced: Given the root of a binary tree, check if the tree is balanced, meaning the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most 1.

Find the kth smallest element in a binary search tree: Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, find the kth smallest element in the tree.

Check if a string is a palindrome: Given a string, check if it's a palindrome (i.e. it reads the same forward and backward).

Reverse an array: Given an array of integers, reverse the order of the elements in the array.

Find the missing element in an array: Given an array of integers where all elements are distinct and are in the range of 1 to n (n+1 elements), find the missing element in the array.

Find the longest substring without repeating characters: Given a string, find the longest substring without repeating characters.

Merge two sorted arrays: Given two sorted arrays, merge them in order to produce a single sorted array.

Implement a stack with push, pop and min functions: Implement a stack data structure that has push, pop and min functions, where min returns the minimum element in the stack in O(1) time.Reverse a linked list: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the order of the nodes in the list.
